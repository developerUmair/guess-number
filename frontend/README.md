## üåç Process

I started by implementing the functionality for adding new travel destinations (trips). Next, I added the ability to drag and drop trips for effortless organization. Afterward, I focused on adding activities within trips and allowing them to be rearranged or moved between different trips.

Drawing inspiration from modern travel planning apps and tools like TripIt, Notion, and Trello, I styled the board to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface.  

Subsequently, I added options to delete trips and activities and to edit their names. To enhance the user experience, I implemented visual indicators showing the active editing context. Finally, I performed some minor refactoring and styling touch-ups to polish the overall look and feel.

**NOTE:** The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of **DnD-Kit** and **TypeScript** in a practical application. While functional, it is not intended to be a comprehensive travel planning tool.
